# Catalog: Operators via Kustomize (ACM Policies)

This repository will provide [kustomize](https://kustomize.io/) deployments of [OpenShift Operators](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.15/html-single/operators/index) leveraging [Advanced Cluster Manager](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/advanced-cluster-management) [Governance Policies](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.10/html-single/governance/index). These policies simplify operator deployments by using labels.
